Client/Customer/Stakeholder - Customer Service

• Improve customer engagement through improved collaboration, communication & engagement. 
• Improve the customer journeys on GSS owned technology architecture and interactions with GSS owned operational processes.


Enhanced Monitoring and Incident Management:

Deployed advanced monitoring tools and automated incident management processes to ensure high availability and performance of customer-facing systems. This included setting up real-time alerts for any anomalies in system behavior and automating response actions for common issues. This reduced downtime and improved system reliability, leading to better customer engagement by ensuring that customers had consistent and reliable access to services.


Established continuous feedback loops between customer service teams and the SRE team. This involved regular review sessions where customer feedback and incident reports were analyzed to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement in the technology architecture. This proactive approach enabled the SRE team to make iterative improvements to the systems, enhancing the overall customer journey by addressing pain points and improving the usability and performance of GSS-owned technologies.





Risk and Controls 
• Actively participate in all internal/external audits and respond to all audit queries in timely manner - 100% adherence required. 
• Ensure adherence to compliance & risk items for your portfolio in a timely manner including: SOX, Audit, ITRC plans/breaks, regulatory items etc completed by the target date with no Risk Acceptance or Non-Compliances. 
• Continuously work towards reducing operational risk.






Developed and deployed automated scripts and tools to continuously monitor compliance with SOX, ITRC, and other regulatory requirements. These tools generate real-time reports and alerts for any deviations or potential non-compliance issues. This ensured timely detection and resolution of compliance issues, leading to 100% adherence to compliance and risk items and reducing the workload for audit preparation and response.

 Integrated a risk management framework into the CI/CD pipeline and operational processes. This included automated risk assessments for new deployments, continuous monitoring of operational risks, and regular risk reviews. By embedding risk management into everyday operations, the SRE team was able to proactively identify and mitigate risks, significantly reducing the number and severity of operational incidents and improving overall risk posture.

Implemented standardized incident and change management processes that include predefined workflows, automated documentation, and mandatory risk assessments for all changes. This also involved regular training for the SRE team on compliance and risk management best practices. These standardized processes ensured that all changes and incidents were handled consistently and in compliance with regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of non-compliance and operational disruptions. This contributed to timely and effective responses to audit queries and continuous improvement in operational risk management.






Run the Bank - CAO Goals

• Decrease RTB spend through infrastructure cost optimization and DEVOPS optimization. 
• Decrease public/private cloud and on-prem infrastructure spend. Create reduction in RTB labor through SRE (Site reliability engineers) upskilling and enabling. 
• Infrastructure spend reduction by $1M, 10% RTB labor reduction. 
• Deliver all prioritized technology programs on time and within the budget. 
• Outcome based quarterly roadmaps agreed upon and delivered. Key business outcomes agreed upon and measured for each technology investment case. 
• Target to reduce RTB spend by 10% • Target 100% of engineers committing code.





Adopted Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate infrastructure provisioning and management, ensuring consistent and efficient use of resources. Automated scaling and resource management were also implemented to optimize on-prem and cloud infrastructure.

Enhanced DevOps practices by optimizing CI/CD pipelines, reducing build and deployment times, and improving test automation. Implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment to streamline code delivery and reduce time to market.Implemented load balancing and caching mechanisms to improve system scalability and reduce latency, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

Implemented comprehensive monitoring and analytics solutions to provide real-time insights into infrastructure performance, usage patterns, and cost drivers. Used these insights to make data-driven decisions for cost optimization.Developed comprehensive operational analytics to track system performance, user behavior, and error rates.


Developed comprehensive operational analytics to track system performance, user behavior, and error rates. Used agile methodologies to adapt and deliver on quarterly roadmaps.

























Teamwork & Leadership - CAO Goals
